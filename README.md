quality-assurance-and-control-tools
===================================

QAACT - Tools for checking WFDSS data for quality, completeness, and for assessing changes between versions of datasets. Tools will focus, at least initially, on counts and acreages within summary units- some will be political, such as county- or state-level summary statistics, and others will be arbitrary spatial units such as grids at various scales.

The analysis blocks will be stored in a geodatabase. 

At least initially, all tools will be prototyped using ESRI tools. There is room to build this analysis using open source tools as well.
